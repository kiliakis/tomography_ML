# TODO IPAC paper
1. Get intensity data from nxcals, associate with ions, extract values and compare against other methods
2. Retrain model on multi-bunch runs, test improvement in accuracy 
3. Retrain on ions, evaluate improvement in accuracy
4. 2-3 can be combined
5. vs traditional methods, i.e. data augmentation
6. Transfer learning approach (find jonathan code and test resnet)

* Need to define proper metrics 
* The total loss should the mean of the metrics
* This helps me to group the losses. 
    * One group seems to be: phase_error, energy_error, bunch_length
    * Another: intensity, VrfSPS
* Need a way to do this more formally:
    * Correlation between all numbers?
    * Or: 1) I take them one by one (this should be the best scenario for each)
    2) I record the best loss for each
    3) Then take them in pairs, to discover pairs that lose < 10% (maybe 5%)
    4) Then take them in groups of three, repeat. 
    5) Ideally they should be divided in 2-3 groups. 
* All alone:
ph_error: 0.01658582
en_error: 0.0182236
bl: 0.01270374
inten: 0.01982902
Vrf: 0.01496144
mu: 0.0155967
VrfSPS: 0.01368172

* All together: ~0.1
